Beginner Level: Setting Up the Foundation

1. Kubernetes Basics
   - Objective: Set up a basic Kubernetes cluster on your local machine.
   - Steps:
     - Install Minikube or Kind (Kubernetes in Docker) for local Kubernetes clusters.
     - Get familiar with `kubectl` commands (e.g., `kubectl get`, `kubectl describe`, `kubectl apply`).
     - Create simple YAML files for Pods, Services, and Deployments.
   - Outcome: Successfully deploy a single-container application (e.g., Nginx or a simple Node.js app) on the Kubernetes cluster.

2. Basic Service Deployment
   - Objective: A microservice based application is provided to you.
